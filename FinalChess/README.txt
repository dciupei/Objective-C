Project Name: Variant Chess

	This game is built from xcode using objective c. When xcode loads up the program press the run button in the upper left hand corner.The first initial screen is the game. The board will be smaller then the traditional chess and there will be two ways of playing. With the box that says free play if that box is clicked the player will have the choice of choosing to play freely with no restrictions on the pieces or choose variant where the pieces will be restricted in there movement. There is also a help button that has a list of instructions on how to play the game.
